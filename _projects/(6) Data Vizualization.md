### Visualizations of the dataset for Forecasting using Tableau and Minitab

This is a snippet of a sample data visualization from a company whose data I processed and made the visualization for.
the visualization that I did came from Tableau and there are 2 forecasting from Tableau and Minitab.
I compared the forecasting results from the 2 software with the actual data that I had before.

There, it's evident that the forecasting with Tableau closely aligns with the original data initially, but towards the end, there's a larger gap compared to the average gap observed earlier.

On the other hand, using Minitab shows the opposite pattern compared to Tableau. Initially, it exhibits a larger gap than Tableau, but towards the end, it closely resembles the original data.

This is evidenced by the values of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) between Tableau and Minitab.

As a model, Tableau forecasting performs significantly better than Minitab, as it exhibits lower values of RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. However, when compared to the actual data, it turns out that Minitab's RMSE, MAPE, and MAE are superior.
