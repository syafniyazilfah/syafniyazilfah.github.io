### Visualizations of the dataset using Looker Studio, Spreadsheet and Python
<br />
For the visualization, I used Looker Studio (formerly known as Google Data Studio).
<br />
Before creating the visualizations, I cleaned the data (sourced from a spreadsheet) using Python. After obtaining the clean data, I imported it back into the spreadsheet to make it easier to read in Looker Studio (a Google product).

<br />
This is a snippet of a sample data visualization from a company whose data I processed and made the visualization for.
<br />
It shows that the revenue generated by the sales team this semester fell significantly short of the target, reaching less than 1%. This calls for a review of the KPI for the sales team’s revenue segment, considering both internal and external factors, as well as collaborating with the marketing team to create promotions that can better attract customers to our products.
<br />
Additionally, the ads cost worsened the situation, with spending exceeding the target for the semester. This suggests that our target audience is not sufficiently interested in the products we advertised. Therefore, a reassessment of the keywords used in our advertising is necessary to improve future campaigns. Furthermore, evaluating the advertising strategies applied by the ad team is crucial. Testing can also be conducted to assess the effectiveness of these decisions, ensuring that future revenue can adequately cover advertising expenses.

<br />
The comparison between the revenue generated and the expenses incurred to achieve that revenue appears favorable, as the expenses are not exceeding the revenue. However, for leads, the revenue-to-expense ratio is around 9:1, and for the marketplace, it’s approximately 10:1, which is quite challenging and less efficient. 
<br />
Therefore, further analysis is needed to identify essential expenses versus those that can be postponed. This can be done by conducting a cross-discussion with the marketing team to delve into the expense details and gain deeper insights.
<br />
The repeat segment represents repeat purchases by customers (customers making additional purchases). It’s evident that repeat customers spend an average of Rp 173,000 per purchase, with a total of 11,500 transactions. However, the revenue generated from these repeat purchases does not sufficiently cover the costs incurred. By analyzing these 11,500 repeat transactions, a survey could be conducted to gather customer feedback on our products. Offering incentives such as vouchers or products in return could help boost customer engagement.

<br />
Here is a dashboard I created to visualize the marketing team’s performance in social media, using dummy data.
It shows that the marketing team’s achievements in October fell significantly short of the target. As a result, the target was adjusted lower for the following month. However, only the Link Clicks metric came close to meeting the new target. This could indicate that visitors are attracted by our branding but find the videos or posts less engaging.

<br /><br />
To improve performance next month, several strategies can be implemented, such as collaborating with influential figures in our brand’s field, creating trend-inspired content with interesting twists to capture visitors’ attention, like impactful openings or presenting the content with some pauses, making it feel less like hard marketing.

### Forecastiong of the dataset B2B using ARIMA (python)

<br />
The first step after cleaning the data is to check it by examining the p-value. As we can see, the p-value is lower than 0.05, which indicates that the data is stationary. Therefore, we can proceed to use the real data for forecasting.

<br />
<br />
Next, the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) and Autocorrelation Function (ACF) are required to determine the ARIMA model.

![](https://i.ibb.co.com/zSDrzx4/pacf.png)
<br />
It is observed that the PACF begins to approach 0 after lag 2 and lag 3, and the same pattern is seen in the ACF. Therefore, the following ARIMA models are proposed: (2,0,2), (2,0,3), (3,0,2), and (3,0,3).

<br />
<br />
From these four models, the following errors were obtained:
<br />
![](https://i.ibb.co.com/9HR9f12/Screenshot-2024-11-05-132859.png)
<br />
From the three error calculations, it is evident that the ARIMA(3,0,3) model has the lowest error values for RMSE and MSE. Therefore, the model that will be used for forecasting sales revenue is ARIMA(3,0,3) to estimate the sales revenue for the next 30 days, utilizing data from the last 10 months.

### Trend Analysis of the dataset B2B

<br />
To examine the presence of seasonality in the trend, the following plot was obtained:

<br />
![](https://i.ibb.co.com/GHPRsyH/newplot.png)
<br />
It can be seen that there is no seasonal trend in sales revenue, so a deeper analysis is needed to understand when trends rise and fall.

<br />
Upon examining the specific dates when these fluctuations occur, it turns out these dates do not align with any events. Therefore, it can be concluded that B2B purchases drive this trend, based on each agent’s cash flow. This conclusion stems from further data analysis showing that certain agents purchase more than four times in a single month, but then only once—or not at all—in the following months. Occasionally, there is a single, large purchase within a month.
<br />
To address this, the sales team could coordinate with the partnership team to negotiate and create promotions for B2B or agents by linking them to event dates, encouraging more consistent purchasing behavior.
