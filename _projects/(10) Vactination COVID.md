## Dashboard Overview

This dashboard, created using Looker Studio, presents the results of a survey on COVID-19 vaccination side effects involving 220 respondents. Each category in the survey was rated on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated mild side effects and 5 indicated severe side effects.

### Demographics and Vaccination Trends

- The majority of respondents were aged between 30-39.
- Most respondents had received only a single dose of the vaccine.

### Key Insights

Out of the 10 side effect categories surveyed, there were 6 conditions where the majority of respondents reported experiencing **severe side effects** (rating 5). These categories were:

- *Chills and Diarrhea*
- *Body Pains*
- *Resilience*
- *Sleeplessness*
- *Confidence about COVID-19*
- *Effect on Reproduction*

Interestingly, only one of these categories, *Confidence about COVID-19*, had a **positive nature**. This is likely due to the vaccine providing a sense of security and hope amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

### Notable Findings

- **Body Pains**:  
  Despite the majority selecting a 5 (*severe*), a significant number of respondents also chose a 2 (*mild*). This suggests that *Body Pains* may not be universally severe across respondents. The variation might be attributed to individual immunity levels and pain tolerance.

- **Similar Patterns**:  
  A similar trend was observed in categories such as:
  - *Hair Loss*
  - *Decreased Quality of Life*
  - *Chills and Diarrhea*
  - *Resilience*
  - *Confidence about COVID-19*  
  where responses were more varied.

- **Consistent Responses**:  
  However, certain categories like *Sleeplessness*, *Social Responsibility*, and *Effect on Reproduction* had more consistent ratings, predominantly in the 3, 4, and 5 range. This indicates that these side effects tended to be **moderate to severe** across the board.

### Conclusion

Based on the survey, it can be concluded that the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine had a more pronounced impact on:

- *Sleeplessness*
- *Social Responsibility*
- *Effect on Reproduction*

while other side effects showed more variability in how they were experienced by respondents.

I was curious about the side effects experienced by the elderly, as they generally have weaker immune systems compared to the working-age population.

From 48 respondents of elderly, it turns out that a significant number of elderly respondents reported experiencing severe side effects in the categories of *Resilience*, *Decreased Quality of Life*, *Effect on Reproduction*, and *Sleeplessness*. For *Social Responsibility* and *Body Pains*, the severity was also relatively high, though most respondents rated these categories a 3. However, the next most common ratings were either 4 and 5, or 4 and 2, followed by 5.

There was a stable trend in the *Chills and Diarrhea* category, where respondents generally reported mild side effects. Meanwhile, *Body Pains* and *Sleeplessness* tended to be severe, as were *Social Responsibility* and *Effect on Reproduction*. Lastly, *Resilience* was also frequently rated as a severe side effect.



## Dashboard Overview with Respondent Over 60 years old with 3 doses vaccine

For elderly individuals who received 3 doses of the vaccine, as reported by 9 respondents in the survey, they tended to experience **high side effects** in the categories of *Chills and Diarrhea*, *Hair Loss*, *Resilience*, *Effect on Reproduction*, *Social Responsibility*, and *Confidence about COVID-19*.

For *Decreased Quality of Life*, most respondents rated it a 4, but this was followed by ratings of 2 and 1, indicating that it does not always cause severe side effects.

This trend was also observed in the categories of *Sleeplessness* and *Body Pains*.

As for *Overweight*, respondents generally reported **low side effects** in this category.

For elderly individuals who received 1 dose of the vaccine, as reported by 26 respondents in the survey, they tended to experience **high side effects** in the categories of *Effect on Reproduction*, *Social Responsibility*, *Sleeplessness*, *Overweight*, *Decreased Quality of Life*, and *Body Pains*.

For *Decreased Quality of Life*, most respondents rated it a 4, followed by a 1, and then 3 and 5, indicating a tendency towards more severe side effects.

As for *Confidence about COVID-19*, respondents generally reported **low side effects** in this category, as well as for *Chills and Diarrhea*.

This is quite different from the respondents who received 3 doses of the vaccine on Chills and Diarrhe, Resilliance, Conffidance about COVID-19, Over weight dan Body Pains
