  description:  I developed automation for the warehouse admin team of the Purela brand, streamlining the process of inputting sales data from e-commerce platforms like TikTok and Shopee.
                <br><br>This automation significantly improved efficiency by processing shipment receipts in PDF format using Python, extracting essential information such as product names, order IDs, items sold, and prices, and converting the data into an Excel format.
                <br><br>This solution enhanced the accuracy and speed of sales data reconciliation for the warehouse team.
                <br><br>Additionally, I created a sales dashboard using Looker Studio, which provided the sales manager with critical insights to optimize sales strategies.
                <br><br>This dashboard also helped the customer service (CS) team improve their approach to increasing sales and handling product returns, contributing to higher customer satisfaction and reduced return rates.
                <br><br>I also integrated data from the company website, cleaning and organizing data from PDF files to be used by the purchasing team.
                <br><br>This integration included extracting essential details such as factory names, product quantities, product types, and purchase order numbers, ensuring the purchasing team had accurate and actionable data.
                <br><br> Moreover, I developed a B2B sales forecasting model using ARIMA with Python, as Looker Studio lacks built-in forecasting features. This model enabled the sales manager to plan and implement strategies for meeting sales targets more effectively by anticipating future sales trends.
                <br><br> Additionally, I built a Looker Studio dashboard for keyword insights from TikTok, which provided the marketing team with valuable keywords to attract buyers. The data was sourced from TikTok ads, identifying those most relevant to the companyâ€™s products.
                <br> 
                <br><br> Due to the lack of an integrated database system at the company, I also ensured daily, weekly, and monthly updates to various dashboards, maintaining data accuracy and supporting decision-making across different departments.

  description:  During my time at the startup company, I've undertaken numerous foundational tasks. One such responsibility involved automating the conversion of raw e-commerce sales data into a format compatible with jurnal.id for seamless uploading.
                <br><br> Concurrently, I crafted visualizations illustrating sales distribution and customer insights across product categories. <br>These visual representations not only informed our warehouse, business, and R&D teams but also served as actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
                <br><br>  I also managed a project focused on monitoring the development of toddlers consuming our products in specified doses. This project involved two groups with different treatments, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the products we provide.
                <br><br> Moreover, I extended support to the finance team by streamlining data organization within spreadsheets, particularly concerning cash inflow and outflow. This collaborative effort ensured greater efficiency in financial tracking.

  description:  The place where I first got to know and learn about SQL, data visualization, and started from scratch with mentors is where I feel this role is a combination of things I love - involving data, visuals, discussions, and presentations. But I realize that I still have a lot to learn.
                <br><br> Even though I interned here for 6 months and worked on 2 use cases, the learning I gained has shaped my career goals.
                <br> <br> During my internship here, I've exchanged knowledge by providing insights on forecasting using Minitab.
