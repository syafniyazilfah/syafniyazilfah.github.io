  description: During my time at PT Sinergi Ayu Semesta, I’ve been deeply involved in optimizing data workflows and building tools that connect data to real business needs. One of my early contributions was developing automation for the warehouse team, converting shipment receipts from PDF to structured Excel data using Python. This significantly improved accuracy and efficiency for managing daily e-commerce sales on platforms like TikTok and Shopee.
              <br><br>I also built multiple dashboards in Looker Studio to help sales managers track performance and assist the customer service (CS) team in reducing product return rates. Seeing the impact of data-driven decisions on day-to-day operations became a key motivation for me.
              <br><br>As the CRM division was introduced, I shifted my focus to customer lifecycle analytics, handling metrics like AOV, GMV, and CLTV while leading the migration of dashboards to Metabase for better operational reporting.
              <br><br>With no centralized database at the time, I also managed routine updates of reports across teams, ensuring every department had reliable and actionable insights. I even went a step further by developing an ARIMA-based B2B forecasting model to support long-term sales strategies, filling in gaps where our BI tools fell short.
              <br><br>I’m passionate about turning messy, fragmented data into clear insights that drive action — not just reporting numbers, but helping teams make better decisions every day.

  description:  During my time at the startup company, I've undertaken numerous foundational tasks. One such responsibility involved automating the conversion of raw e-commerce sales data into a format compatible with jurnal.id for seamless uploading.
                <br><br> Concurrently, I crafted visualizations illustrating sales distribution and customer insights across product categories. <br>These visual representations not only informed our warehouse, business, and R&D teams but also served as actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
                <br><br>  I also managed a project focused on monitoring the development of toddlers consuming our products in specified doses. This project involved two groups with different treatments, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the products we provide.
                <br><br> Moreover, I extended support to the finance team by streamlining data organization within spreadsheets, particularly concerning cash inflow and outflow. This collaborative effort ensured greater efficiency in financial tracking.

  description:  The place where I first got to know and learn about SQL, data visualization, and started from scratch with mentors is where I feel this role is a combination of things I love - involving data, visuals, discussions, and presentations. But I realize that I still have a lot to learn.
