  description: During my time at PT Sinergi Ayu Semesta, I’ve been deeply involved in optimizing data workflows and building tools that connect data to real business needs. One of my early contributions was developing automation for the warehouse team, converting shipment receipts from PDF to structured Excel data using Python. This significantly improved accuracy and efficiency for managing daily e-commerce sales on platforms like TikTok and Shopee.
              <br><br>I also built multiple dashboards in Looker Studio to help sales managers track performance and assist the customer service (CS) team in reducing product return rates. Seeing the impact of data-driven decisions on day-to-day operations became a key motivation for me.
              <br><br>As the CRM division was introduced, I shifted my focus to customer lifecycle analytics, handling metrics like AOV, GMV, and CLTV while leading the migration of dashboards to Metabase for better operational reporting.
              <br><br>With no centralized database at the time, I also managed routine updates of reports across teams, ensuring every department had reliable and actionable insights. I even went a step further by developing an ARIMA-based B2B forecasting model to support long-term sales strategies, filling in gaps where our BI tools fell short.
              <br><br>I’m passionate about turning messy, fragmented data into clear insights that drive action — not just reporting numbers, but helping teams make better decisions every day.

  description:  During my time at the startup, I was responsible for laying the groundwork in several key areas of data processing. One of my primary contributions was automating the conversion of raw e-commerce sales data into a format compatible with jurnal.id, streamlining the uploading process and reducing manual work.
                <br><br>Alongside this, I developed visual dashboards that showcased sales distribution and customer insights across product categories. These visualizations provided the warehouse, business, and R&D teams with actionable information for better planning and decision-making.
                <br><br>I also led a project to monitor toddler growth while consuming our products under controlled doses. The project involved two treatment groups and aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our product offerings.
                <br><br>In addition to technical tasks, I supported the finance team by organizing financial data, improving the efficiency of cash inflow and outflow reporting, and contributing to smoother financial operations.
