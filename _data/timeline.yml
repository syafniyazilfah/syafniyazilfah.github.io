  description: During my time at PT Sinergi Ayu Semesta, I’ve been deeply involved in optimizing data workflows and building tools that connect data to real business needs. One of my early contributions was developing automation for the warehouse team, converting shipment receipts from PDF to structured Excel data using Python. This significantly improved accuracy and efficiency for managing daily e-commerce sales on platforms like TikTok and Shopee.
              <br><br>I also built multiple dashboards in Looker Studio to help sales managers track performance and assist the customer service (CS) team in reducing product return rates. Seeing the impact of data-driven decisions on day-to-day operations became a key motivation for me.
              <br><br>As the CRM division was introduced, I shifted my focus to customer lifecycle analytics, handling metrics like AOV, GMV, and CLTV while leading the migration of dashboards to Metabase for better operational reporting.
              <br><br>With no centralized database at the time, I also managed routine updates of reports across teams, ensuring every department had reliable and actionable insights. I even went a step further by developing an ARIMA-based B2B forecasting model to support long-term sales strategies, filling in gaps where our BI tools fell short.
              <br><br>I’m passionate about turning messy, fragmented data into clear insights that drive action — not just reporting numbers, but helping teams make better decisions every day.

  description:  During my time at the startup, I was responsible for laying the groundwork in several key areas of data processing. One of my primary contributions was automating the conversion of raw e-commerce sales data into a format compatible with jurnal.id, streamlining the uploading process and reducing manual work.
                <br><br>Alongside this, I developed visual dashboards that showcased sales distribution and customer insights across product categories. These visualizations provided the warehouse, business, and R&D teams with actionable information for better planning and decision-making.
                <br><br>I also led a project to monitor toddler growth while consuming our products under controlled doses. The project involved two treatment groups and aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of our product offerings.
                <br><br>In addition to technical tasks, I supported the finance team by organizing financial data, improving the efficiency of cash inflow and outflow reporting, and contributing to smoother financial operations.

  to: February, 2022
  description:  The place where I first got to know and learn about SQL, data visualization, and started from scratch with mentors is where I feel this role is a combination of things I love - involving data, visuals, discussions, and presentations. But I realize that I still have a lot to learn.
                <br><br> Even though I interned here for 6 months and worked on 2 use cases, the learning I gained has shaped my career goals.
                <br> <br> During my internship here, I've exchanged knowledge by providing insights on forecasting using Minitab.

- title: Machine Learning Student - Google Bangkit 2021
  from: Feb, 2021
  to: June, 2021
  description:  Bangkit Academy is an exclusive career readiness program initiated by Google and supported by leading Indonesian tech companies, including Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka.
                <br><br>Designed to equip students with in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications, Bangkit offers three interdisciplinary learning paths: Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and Cloud Computing. The curriculum focuses on technical mastery, soft skills development, and English communication, preparing participants for successful careers in the tech industry.
                <br><br>As part of the Bangkit Academy program, I participated in a Capstone Project as a final requirement for graduation. The project was carried out in teams of six members, with two participants from each learning path (Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and Cloud Computing). Each team selected a theme aligned with real-world problems, and we also received guidance from industry mentors throughout the development process.
                <br><br>My team chose the health sector, focusing specifically on the issue of stunting prevention. We developed a mobile application designed to detect the nutritional content of foods for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and toddlers, addressing the critical first 1000 days of a child's life—a crucial period for preventing stunting.
                <br><br>I was responsible for the Machine Learning aspect of the project. I implemented YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) as our object detection model because of its ability to detect multiple objects in an image simultaneously. Since there was no readily available dataset for Indonesian foods, we collected and labeled the dataset ourselves as a team.
                <br><br>One of the challenges we faced was that calculating nutrition requires knowing the weight of the food, while our image data alone wasn't sufficient for that purpose. To solve this, we added an input feature allowing users to enter the estimated weight of the food manually.
                <br><br>Beyond food detection and nutritional analysis, the app also featured:
                <br>- Personalized menu recommendations based on the user’s budget
                <br>- Educational content about nutrition, maternal and child health, and stunting prevention
                <br>- This project taught me not only technical skills but also the importance of collaboration, time management, and adapting solutions to real-world limitations.

                <br><br> I also developed my public speaking skills and discovered that speaking in front of an audience isn’t intimidating at all — it’s actually exciting. What I once thought was fear turned out to be just a mental barrier, and overcoming it gave me more confidence to express my ideas clearly.
