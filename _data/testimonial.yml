This has been very helpful for me in the process of monitoring and tracking sales, as well as supporting faster and more accurate decision-making.
                
                In addition to having a good understanding of the projects assigned and delivering outputs according to needs, Zilfah also takes the initiative to contribute valuable ideas.

  testimonial : |-
                I have been greatly helped by having Zilfah as a Data Analyst in supporting the warehouse, especially the admin team. One of the most impactful contributions was when Zilfah created a tool using Google Colab to convert receipt data from PDF format into ready-to-use Excel files. This tool has been a huge help for the warehouse admin team because we no longer have to copy and paste the data manually one by one — even though the data can reach up to 4,000 addresses per day across all business units. This solution has truly made our workflow much more efficient.
                
                What I appreciate the most is that Zilfah doesn’t just focus on the technical side but also genuinely cares about helping her colleagues. She often asks directly, 'Is there anything I can help you with?'
