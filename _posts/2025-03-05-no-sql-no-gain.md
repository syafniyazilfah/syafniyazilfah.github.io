As a Data Analyst assigned to the IT Division, I encountered challenges related to limited access to server resources, despite the critical role I play in data analysis. This situation is partly due to organizational structure where my reporting line differs from the business units I support, which sometimes creates gaps in communication and resource allocation.

## So, how do i improve my SQL skills?
Because I couldn’t use SQL for work at the company and didn’t want to lose my SQL skills, I decided to keep practicing repeatedly through LeetCode and DataCamp, as well as studying on W3Schools.

## <br /> The problem is, there’s no real data to work with — it’s all just practice cases.
Well, I learned how to import CSV data into MySQL Workbench and looked for datasets on Kaggle to practice. Also, when I installed MySQL Workbench, it came with sample data, so I could explore and practice writing join queries there.
