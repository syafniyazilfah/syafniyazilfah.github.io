the sad things are, i am a Data Analyst in IT Division which has a leader who don't know about what a job desk of Data Analyst (yap, when interview user, the user is Sales Manager, aku ditempatkan di IT Division because there are alot of business unit, so it must be fair if i'm in IT Division). The leader has the access of the server, but no access for me.

## So, how do i improve my SQL skills?
<br /> Because I couldn’t use SQL for work at the company and didn’t want to lose my SQL skills, I decided to keep practicing repeatedly through LeetCode and DataCamp, as well as studying on W3Schools.

## The problem is, there’s no real data to work with — it’s all just practice cases.
<br /> Well, I learned how to import CSV data into MySQL Workbench and looked for datasets on Kaggle to practice. Also, when I installed MySQL Workbench, it came with sample data, so I could explore and practice writing join queries there.
