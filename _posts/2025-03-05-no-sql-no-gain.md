The sad part is, I’m a Data Analyst placed in the IT Division, led by someone who doesn’t even understand the actual role of a Data Analyst. (Yep — during the interview, the hiring manager was from the Sales division, but I was placed in IT because there are many business units, so they thought it would be “fair” to put me there.) The problem is, while my leader has access to the server, I don’t have any access at all.

## So, how do i improve my SQL skills?
Because I couldn’t use SQL for work at the company and didn’t want to lose my SQL skills, I decided to keep practicing repeatedly through LeetCode and DataCamp, as well as studying on W3Schools.

## <br /> The problem is, there’s no real data to work with — it’s all just practice cases.
Well, I learned how to import CSV data into MySQL Workbench and looked for datasets on Kaggle to practice. Also, when I installed MySQL Workbench, it came with sample data, so I could explore and practice writing join queries there.
