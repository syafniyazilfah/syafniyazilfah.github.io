# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm currently a Data Analyst Intern at Qiscus which will be completed in April 2023. Interested in big data and business intelligence. I have focused my research on using statistical methods to analyze official statistical data. Knowledge of several data analysis tools such as Tableau, SQL, Python and the R programming language also can use several design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Clip Studio Paint.
