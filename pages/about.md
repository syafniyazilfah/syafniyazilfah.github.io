# **About Me**

<!-- {% include elements/video.html id="BF3jnCqRzck" %} -->

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m a Data Analyst with a strong interest in big data and business intelligence. I focus on applying statistical methods to transform data into actionable insights that drive smarter business decisions.

I primarily work with SQL, Python, Looker Studio, Power BI, and Metabase for data processing, analysis, and visualization. I also have a creative background in design, using Adobe Illustrator and Clip Studio Paint to enhance how data stories are communicated.

With a combination of analytical skills and creative thinking, I’m passionate about translating complex data into clear, impactful visuals that help businesses grow.

## Education

        <div class="content">
          <h2>Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Indonesia</h2>
          <h6 class="date">2018 - 2022</h6>
          <p>Bachelor of Statistics, Faculty of Science and Data Analytics, with a GPA of 3.44 out of 4.0</p>
          <p>During college, I joined an organization under the Statistics Student Association at Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology called the Statistics Computer Course. I served as an HRD staff member for over a year. In this organization, we also had a program where every member took turns mentoring fellow students who wanted to learn about computer programming.</p>
          <p>I was also involved in a department event called the Statistics Fair (Pekan Raya Statistika), where I worked as a graphic designer responsible for creating Instagram feed designs. Outside of these formal roles, many of my friends who were active in the Statistics Student Association often came to me for advice and discussions about their design work, even though I wasn’t officially part of that organization. I enjoyed these discussions, as they allowed me to exchange ideas and sharpen my creative thinking.</p>
